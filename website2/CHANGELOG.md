# Changelog

CHANGELOG.md standards are inspired by [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.0.2] - 2022-05-19

### Fixed

- Build icons before building website during deploy.

## [0.0.1] - 2022-05-19

### Changed

- After a long journey website got versioning and changelog notes.
- Now using esbuild and nginx: got rid of webpack, documentalist, next and lot of other weird stuff.
- This changelog is not automatically handled â€“ for now we need to sync last version in changelog and package.json by our selfs.
